# spotlight-facetracking

We aimed to make a face tracker that keeps a spotlight on a user. We accomplished this by obtaining an initial bounding box, applying masks, and then using the mean-shift algorithm to update the bounding box. This [report](442_final_report.pdf) aims to describe our methods in approaching, implementing, and testing this project.
